##Projects
(./JapansesKanbanBoard)
This is a school project designed for task management, inspired by the Japanese concept of kanban. In this project:
Admin: Can create, delete, update, and manage tasks, as well as assign tasks to team members.
Members: Work on tasks assigned to them and track their progress.
Both admins and members can view the overall progress to see how much work has been completed.
Noted : I worked on this project as a UI/UX team Member
